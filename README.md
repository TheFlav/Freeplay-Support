# Freeplay-Support

### One Line Installer
To install any of these modules on a fresh RetroPie image, use the following one-liner:
```
bash -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheFlav/Freeplay-Support/master/Full_Install.sh)"
```
It will use a checklist to let you select what modules you would like to install, then download and install them.
